Creating new branch
================
> To create local branch I just use "-b" flag, without "git branch":
> git checkout -b my_feature
 
This command format is absolutely misleading, because there is
an implicit parameter <from_commit_id> that is not stated in the
command.
 
The full command is:
$ git checkout -b my_feature <from_commit_id>
or:
$ git checkout -b my_feature <from_branch_name>
In case the "from" parameter is missing, the current "HEAD" commit id
is used. This is wrong in many cases.
 
I suggest the full command that is always correct:
```
$ git checkout -b my_feature <from_commit_id>
$ git checkout -b my_feature <from_branch_name>
```
For example,
```
$ git checkout -b my_feature origin/master
$ git checkout -b my_feature origin/release_2.7.4

```


I used git rebase not just to change commit message but to rollback 
changes in file.
In the process while ammending in the relevant commit, if I want
to compare a file the its previous version, in order to rollback a change,
I can do it with :
git difftool HEAD~1..HEAD install/nginx/post
