GIT:
===

git basics: 
snapshots, hashing, branches as pointers. changes are not stored.
distributed, no single server
a complete story on your host
modified (working tree), staged - the index (git add), committed (in git db)


remote vs local:
remote tracking branches (origin/master) vs tracking branches (master)
git fetch
git pull (merge / rebase)


rebase vs merge

our workflow and policy
feature branch workflow
	creating feature branch
	develop
	rebase on master (smart rebase)
	push the feature branch (smart push)
	create a PR
	review
	merge to master


task: gerrit
