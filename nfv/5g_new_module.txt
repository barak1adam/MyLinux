new NFV module by Naftali:
=========================

type 7 connector - connect the ComEx, enable 10G connectivity.
we used it also for Denverton (atom) for NFV+LTE

Q7 connectory - enable only 1G
we used it for legacy LTE (Celeron)
good for Denverton and Celeron

NXP can work with both tppe 7 or Q7

Nafatli suggest Q7 as another assembly option for the same design !
