summary nfv port 1:
===================

why not changing the nid layout:
even if naftali suggested to keep the server unchanged and identify which nid is used,
we don't won't to reach a situation in which you have good and bad nids

for smooth imgration also needed extra configs like bellow.

so why to change server and not nid ?

The ultimate solution is to go with data + control for port 9 in the short term,
in the long term add another 1G port on the server connected to the NiD.
1. Only the server card layout will be changed. The NiD HW won't be affected.
2. Think in advance for the day of adding the new port - the cusomters like Telstra 
must not have any change in configuratrions (NiD & Connectory), it must be backward compatible to the current
unification of port 9.

we will add 2 vlan interfaces in advance both on nid side and on Connector side
nid agent will use one of the active interfaces, depends on the server card revision.

nid agent code will be changed

vlan 4092 can't be cahnged, used in other modules

will not impace other customers like orange - they use 4092/ port 1. they will have extra interface too.

nafatli - pci current port -  to be moved ?
