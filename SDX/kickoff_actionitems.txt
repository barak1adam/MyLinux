IronMan - what is supported for SAT. 
	Eran: same like Cetus, 1G.

	Eran sent another question about those 2 issues:
	There is a MAC TG up to 10G but probably not exactly for SAT.
	Marvell dont recommend it for production.

IronMan OAM - what is supported

	1) The OAM FW is needed exactly as it was on Cetus, the same code, it calls the same CPSS API and should not be changed.

	2) It's size was checked and it can run on one of the Ironman uControllers that has 192K memory which is enough to hold it.

	3) On XG-300 it was running on ARMv7 which the same like the ARM uControllers on the Ironman. The ARM-A main cores on Ironman are v8 and it will require extra work to port it from v7 to v8, it's preferred to run it on the uControllers as is.

	it was checked with Igor and Eran
	

Forwarding perfomance with LTE connected with USB and without external CPU
	tested by Eran on XG118
	~10-20Mbps.
	there is a summary in the emails.
