cold / warm reboot meeting with Raghav and Frank:
=================================================

the update about warm/cold is stored in CPLD regs.

SIRM is reading it on init and send this info to all drivers init() funftions.

All drivers will skip the relevant actions on warm reboot - the target is not to break customer services. 
for cold any action is taken by the drivers

the user reboot is considred a gracefull reboot  - synchronized.
it calls the aosStop script and the shutdown () functions of the drivers.

In shutdown, a driver can take acations that will be used after the warm reboot.

For example in Qumran driver, the BCM settings are saved to a file and are restored after warm reboot without repplaying them to the HW, the HW is not touched.
The driver is also calling detach() procedure to close all BCM services gracefully in the driver level only (not in HW !)

examples: DevCpldxg490.cpp, DevQumran2c.cpp

An issue was raised:
--------------------
if the SW is stuck and there a WD timer expires, then it is a kind of warm reboot, but not a gracefull one, but asynchronized.
The BCM settings are not saved to file nor it is gracefully detached. 
Then the u-boot identifes there was no successfull warm reboot and switching it to cold reboot.

Need to:
-------
make sure on this WD timer reboot, to check the last boot cause and refer to it as a warm reboot.
on any BCM action - save the settings to that file and keep it upated and not just upon the user warm reboot.

Remember:
---------
Xg400SirmPlugIn.cpp - check the last reboot cause
WD is enabled only in production mode
