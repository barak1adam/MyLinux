BCM SW on xg490:

DTE is an ADVA implementation (it has CLI that calls ADVA API)

Qumran App binary is an ADVA implementation ( use adva and BCM libs ). works with CINT / DTE


DTE / Qumran app ------- > driver ---------> BCM sdk


Usually SDK is built without symbols, in order to debug - we build the relevant BCM lib with symbols and cp it to the device.


investigate source code flows:
DnxDte....cpp / Dnx...system.cpp ------ > CompDnxQueue....cpp

Reuven:
each port has 8 queues
each protocol has 4 strict queues
