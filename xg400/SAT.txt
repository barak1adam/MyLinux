According Emil the line-rate 400G capability of Qumran's SAT module can be differed

Feature summary:
Up to 400Gb/s data rate.
Transmit 64 flows.
Receiving 128 flows.
Seems only support up direction.

SAT has 2 main parts:

Tests part: in Qumran 2C
Data RatePacket Loss rate (PLR): 
Lost, erroneous, and misordered packets.

FTD and FDV part: in FPGA
Frame Transmission Delay(FTD): maximum, minimum, averageFrame Delay Variation (FDV): in a 10-bin histogram.
