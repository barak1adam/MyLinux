AOS Questions to Michal:
========================

what is exactly built unde (all binaries) for all AOS Apps. 

what is AOS SDK after cmake in the pipeline

when is the EOS created and what exactly included?

after the base image build, what is under Build/xg490, Build/xg490/Staging, Install...? what is the diff between build and install ...?
(usually we have all artifacts under build and rootfs installed artifcats under install)

how to build a cross-compile gentoo pkg for my target?

how to manipulate the list of my gentoo packages in my product?

how to build gentoo minimal set or just linux?

what USE is used? from whihc conf file?
./usr/share/crossdev/etc/portage/make.conf
./etc/portage/make.conf
./targ/arch/aarch64-linux-gnu/modes/eos/etc/portage/make.conf

Josh - in EDE need to use sudo for every single command

What is the idea of updating the HOST EDE itself?

what is the relevant repo in gerrit?

how lists f packages are managed for embedded target? where the lists are built?

how is the rootfs composed?

what is exactly prod, prod_devel and all these product_copy_sync scripts?

fsmodes?

rootfs: /targ/arch/aarch64-linux-gnu/modes/eos

When the full image is built:

/targ/prod/xg490/med/proxy/main = /targ/arch/aarch64-linux-gnu/modes/eos

ADVA apps are placed into:    
/targ/prod/xg490/med/proxy/adva/aos


barak:
docker from Josh
build an AOS app and watch what is placed where, including debug symbols
build image only with distribution
boot with linux only, no aos
