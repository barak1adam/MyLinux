-------------
bug on warm reboot
happens on GUI/Serial/SSH
there is a ping
we had it before login (in dev mode)
sometimes you can't type any input for user / password, so it's not related to login


settings aspect:
----------------

no bug:
without AOS, only Linux
factory defaults
no ptp license + no ptp settings


--local time backward + full config
--future time + default config
isAnyValidLicense = FALSE + PTP node lock and then server

bug:
ptp + node lock licensing
ptp + server licensing
isAnyValidLicense = FALSE
source clock = local + ptp licensing + ptp settings to work as slave but not used for date time


under test:
no LM process + no LM plugin
source clock = local + ptp licensing  without other ptp settings

more sw aspects:
----------------
24.1.1 1099 is good
24.1.1 1110 is bad
builds in-between make a different bug - invalid user name and password

what to show:
-------------
logs 9 and 10 and the thread under product
the lm monitoring debug messages with isAnyValidLicense = FALSE


tests by SVT:
=============
1) date-time local, licnese ptp = node lock, no ptp clock/ports configured --------------> reproduced yesterday after 15 reboots.
2) date-time local, licnese ptp = node lock, ptp-clock + ptp-port on physical port --------------- > not reproduced
3) date-time local, licnese ptp = node lock, ptp-clock + ptp-port on lag port --------> under test
