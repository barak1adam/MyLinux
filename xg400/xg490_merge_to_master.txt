merge dev-xg490 with master:

on product:
	rebase and move it to master branch
	
AOS - all repos are now built with their own dev-xg490 branch

upgrade product to EDE 3.10.3, because master and product should be built with the same EDE

fix f4-model to align it with AOS

build with AOS master

test it

for each AOS repo merge changes into master and test them one by one.
need to make sure all other products are not affected !
According to Raghav it might take few days up to few weeks.
