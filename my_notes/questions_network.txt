subnet overlapping

to send a packet, the network address part is testet using the mask
2 addresses which have the same network address part, cannot be defined over 
different interfaces - we will not be able to decide what interface to use for TX.


Reuven,

ip forwarding - assume 10.10.10.10 and 20.20.20.20 are defined on the same
machine but on different interfaces
sending a ping from network 10.10.10.x towards 20.20.20.20, will it succeed?
