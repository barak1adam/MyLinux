tasks in MRV:

build env

kernel:
	rtc driver - driver was not compiled, not registered
	lattice driver
	dg driver
	vrrp vmac
	mdio driver and R/W routines
	hot swap module
dist:
	add valgrind pkg and support + training
	add minicom
	fix aufs
	keepalived
	i2c tools
	
u-boot:
	i2c read/write all eeprom
	add new board ids and support new hw like OD, V20. load new dtb files to RAM.
	tftp retries
user space OS-V:
	lattice interrupts
	vrrp
	spi fixes
	i2c fixes
	signals bugs: RFC starvation, seg fualts(block signals in UiD_SubscribeEventsWithCallback thread, to avoid seg fault)
	handle core dump files - save permanently and training.
user space OPX:
	serial redirection to LC
	critical bug fixes
	add valgrind

tools:
	git + training
	bitbucket + training
	TC
	valgrind
	gdb
	Jira

aws / x86, python

sdn/nfv, openstack

marvell support and new lsp
	
learn my fpga driver:
	kernel space - kernel config + build as part of the kernel, driver work flow, dts, platform devices
	user space - interrupts tree

at kernel:
alternatives for notifying the user space:
	sysfs: events or poll (supported by gpio)
	shared mem
	wait q
	sys v semaphore ?
	sockets ?
