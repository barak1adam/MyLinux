In Agema - add build configuration for static analysis
last step of running "parse_kw_results_for_tc.py" is not MUST - its purpose is to
import the kw results into TC HTML screens
for now, I will add just 4 steps that build the KW report in the KW server.

It is important because client kw analysis are running now compared to OPX db.

Add it with scheduler trigger

In application incremental builds:
Kw is running on the step of Code Inspection and runs 
kw_utils/parse_local_results.py
this script retrive latest analysis results from server, compare client
analysis to this server and db and show the results in TC.


AI:
1. get from Ziki list of file by KW - I will run git log -p for each
2. Integrate parse_kw_results_for_tc.py
