focus on CS and technology:
============================
1. Benny, MRV and the linux Kernel - emphsize the focus on SW only
2. MRV gave me a sense of proportions - I am not so bad, not everyone knows everything, HW is not so important, 
everybody make mistakes and bugs - it's not a disaster - the point is to fix them and provide a final clean and reliable product.
3. The willing for perfect - IDC is not enough
4. The self recognition of my outstanding ability to go deep inside, into the most last detail and perfect understanding (no gaps)
5. RAD as final evidence that taking responsibility on my own is the only model for long run in hitech
6. The longing for my great study success in childhood
7. Zabo - The recognition of focus an persistance
8. Kobi - The recognition of going till the end is not black and white
9. Unbearable feeling of other people around me graduating best universities degrees, like it is out of my scope
10. My self strong believe in my own way and that I desrve the biggest things ever
11. Kobi and the long process of belive im myself, knowing myself, facing the fears and feel when is the rigth time for me to do
12. Mobileye and other exits
13. Tomer and Roy
14. Duvdevani - life is short, self realization, I can do much more than him
15. Everyone is totally sleeping and disapointed of me, no expectations at all!
