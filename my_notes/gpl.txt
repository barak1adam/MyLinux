GPL is free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.
Any derivative work (modified SW based on the original) can only be distributed under the same license terms !
The idea is to assure the open source community that the free SW would not be only exploited by sw companies to earn money, 
but would remain free and keep being contributed both by the community and the companies as well.
