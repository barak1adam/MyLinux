valgrind installation:
----------------------

To install from a tar.bz2 distribution:

  4. Run ./configure, with some options if you wish.  The only interesting
     one is the usual --prefix=/where/you/want/it/installed.

  5. Run "make".

  6. Run "make install", possibly as root if the destination permissions
     require that.

  7. See if it works.  Try "valgrind ls -l".  Either this works, or it
     bombs out with some complaint.  In that case, please let us know
     (see www.valgrind.org).

Important!  Do not move the valgrind installation into a place
different from that specified by --prefix at build time.  This will
cause things to break in subtle ways, mostly when Valgrind handles
fork/exec calls.


The Valgrind Developers

Next Gen:
---------

add the zip file to dist_packages

add an entry to pkg.txt
(leave it in comment. we will build it just if we need to)

mkdir on the PC: /opt/valgridn (create the dir which specified in the valgrind/configure file)

chown of /opt - to let us run make install not as sudo:

chown -R `whoami`:`whoami` /opt/

./buildone valgrind ---> output will be in opt/valgrind

manually copy all output to build/dist/arm../opt/valgrind

to run valgrind successfully, need to have also non-stripped c libs (especially the ld.so which is the dynamic linker, used by the programs to load other libraries)
(build/dist/arm../lib):
scripts/./pkginstall.sh libc 1

check it: file ../dist/arm_msys_root/lib/libc.so
