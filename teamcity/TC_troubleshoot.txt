TeamCity trouble-shooting:
=========================

how to debug the server:
ssh to foxtrot, then "tail -f teamcity-server.log"
ssh from another terminal and start the service, watch the log for errors


how to debug the agent:
ssh to foxtrot, then "~/buildAgent/logs$ tail -f teamcity-agent.log"
ssh from another terminal and start the agent service, watch the log for errors

I had errors with permissions:
sudo chown mrv:mrv /home/mrv/temp -R

same issue I had in foxtrot as agent:
mrv@Foxtrot:~/buildAgent$ sudo chown mrv:mrv -R .

~/buildAgent - the agent directory
~/TeamCity - the server directory
~/.buildServer - the server settings

agents - they keep the latest build sources and objects
but the final artifacts are saved on the server - foxtrot

So, if I remove agent, I am not loosing the artifacts.


server settings:
mrv@Foxtrot:~/.BuildServer$ find . -name "database.properties"
./config/database.properties

agent settings:
buildAgent.properties in mrv@Foxtrot:~/buildAgent/conf

it is possible to pool out an agent: unauthorized agent or disable agent

it is possible to pool out build config by: Actions --- >Archive project...

License upgrade is done automatically

TeamCity Upgrade is recommended

Agent Cloud - create new cloud profile - to add a new Amazon agent
URL should be added as we did with nginx proxy...


TeamCity SSH keys for bitbucket:
================================
In general when you make SSH connection, then you use private key (id_rsa) and the public key is used by the remote server I try to connect to (id_rsa.pub).
so TC is using a private SSH key and in BitBucket there is the public key.
A key is a property of the user not of a machine, so one key can be used on different machines owned by the same user.
TC is using it private key that we configured for all projects. it is set as an uploaded key on the VCS Root project and inherited for all sub-projects.
In bitbucket the public key is added for that user (mrv)

But when projects like the Distribution is built by TC on one agent, then sub projects are built by our ../install/<project>/build/compile script
In this script a clone is done, but it is not under TC context, so the ssh key on the agent is used instead.
This is the reason we had to copy some agent keys to some specific projects...
The good practice is to copy the same private key of the mrv user,as used by TC, to all agents and then the same key will be used
and we don't have to add other keys for projects. --- I did it - I copied it from foxtrot:/home/mrv/.ssh/...
