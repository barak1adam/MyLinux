GVIM tips:
---------
pipe output into vim:
ls -la | vim -
ls -la | gvim -

run cscope in the root dir: cscope -Rbk

open included file (on cursor) in a new tab: CTRL+W, gf
(gf - go to file)

open a file in the same buffer: :e <file>

show open files in the same buffer: ,+ 0

cscope:
-------
go to definition: CTRL + ]
go back: CTRL + T

[[ - jump to start of current function


move between open tabs:
CTRL + pgDown, CTRL + pgUp

move to last active tab: CTRL+L (c-l)
(I've added a mapping)

F9 - outline functions, variables
F9 - close

show line numbers:
:set nu

i - insert before the cursor position
a - insert after the current postion
A - insert at the end of the line


e - go to the end of the line
0 - go to the begining of the line.

CTRL + ] jump to tag
CTRL + T, CTRL + O pop last tag


copy and paste:
--------------
esc + y + $ - cp to the end of the line
esc + p - paste it

esc + y + w - cp to the end of the word
esc + p - paste it

select then copy and paste:
----------------------------
esc+v
e - select to the end of words
$ - to the end of line
h,j,k,l - select with arrows

then y

then p 

p PASTE AFTER THE CURSOR !
P paste before the cursor !


viw - select word under the cursor (copy to default register "")
yiw - select word under the cursor and copy it (copy to default register "" and to "0 register)

use xnoremap p "_dP to make "p" always paste what in "0, e.g what was originally yanked.


yiw - copy current word
viwp - select other word under the cursor and paste what was yanked. will paste it again till something else is yanked.


copy out of GVIM:
----------------
viw - select word
V - select a line withouy the ending newline char
ve - select till the end of word
vw - select till the next word
v$ - select to end of line

then paste with mouse middle button



normal mode:
-------------
"+yiw - copy current word to clipboard
"5p - paste what in register 5
"0p - paste what in register 0, e.g what was just yanked
"*p - paste what in register *, e.g what was last selected


insert mode:
------------
you get " by typing CTRL+r

"5 - paste what in register 5
"0 - paste what in register 0, e.g what was just yanked
"* - paste what in register *, e.g what was last selected

visual mode:
------------
viw "+y - select current word, then copy what is selected to clipboard

better to use the mouse here...

select all
==========
gg v G y

:%y+



mappings:
--------

:unmap ,tn
:map tn :tabnew <C-R>* <CR> //open in a new tab what is selected by the mouse
:map c :close <CR> //close tab
:Bclose - close buffer
,bd - close buffer


:tabnew . //open folder view
mouse click on file to open it
select the file name by "V", then press "tn"
CTRL-O - back to prev buffer



movement:
--------------------------------------------------
e - move cursor to end of word
w - move cursor to start of the next word
b - same like "w", but backwords
0 - start of line
$ - end of line
G - moves to the end of the file.
gg - start of file
number  G  moves to that line number
j$ - end of the next line

H: Move cursor to the top of the currently visible page (think "high")

M: Move cursor to the middle of the currently visible page

L: Move cursor to the bottom of the currently visible page (think "low")

CTRL-D: Page down

CTRL-U: Page up


m: Typing "m" followed by a letter creates a mark reference by that letter.
	Lower-case letters are specific to the current document, while upper-case letters can only be used once (they can be used to jump to sections in different documents.

': The single quote followed by a mark letter (previously defined with the "m" as above), will move the cursor to the beginning of the line containing that mark.

`: The back-tick followed by a mark letter will move the cursor to the exact position of the mark.


gvim back and forward:
---------------------
CTRL+o back
CTRL+i forward

how to go back to my last editing position ?
1) u + CTRL+R (undo + redo)
2) `.

^ - move to the begining of the text in a line, not to 0.

--------------------------------------------------

insert:
--------------------------------------------------
i - insert before the cursor
a - insert after the cursor
A - insert at the end of the line
o - open a new line after the current line (line of cursor)
O - open a new line before (UPPER) the current line (line of cursor)


add a new line down the current line, change to insert mode and locate the cursor exactly down the start of the current line:
ESC + o
same, but above the current line:
ESC+SHIFT+o
----------------------------------------------------


indent:
---------
ESC+V
select lines
> to indent selected lines
< to de-indent

>G     Indent until end of file
>}     Indent until next paragraph
>iB    Indent contents of current { } block

set tab to 2 spaces:
:set tabstop=2

                               Lesson 1 SUMMARY


  1. The cursor is moved using either the arrow keys or the hjkl keys.
         h (left)       j (down)       k (up)       l (right)

  2. To start Vim from the shell prompt type:  vim FILENAME <ENTER>

  3. To exit Vim type:     <ESC>   :q!   <ENTER>  to trash all changes.
             OR type:      <ESC>   :wq   <ENTER>  to save the changes.
			 wa, wall, wa! - save all changes
             ZZ - commit changes and exit the file.
             :e! - reload

  4. To delete the character at the cursor type:  x

  2. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:    d$
  3. To delete a whole line type:    dd
  
  to join 2 lines, type J

  4. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w
  5. The format for a change command is:
               operator   [number]   motion
     where:
       operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
       [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
       motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),
                  $ (to the end of line), etc.

  6. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0

  7. To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)
     To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)
     To undo the undo's, type:                 CTRL-R
     
     undo /redo - refers to commands. e.g typing 10 letters then ESC, considered one command.

     character you want to have there.

  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the
     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of
     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.

  4. The format for change is:

         c   [number]   motion

:cs add cscpe.out (add cscope to gvim)

4. navigation:

go to definition: CTRL + ]
go back: CTRL + T

[[ - jump to start of current function


vertical editing:
-----------------

ESC CTRL+V to enter visual block mode

select text vertically

x - to cut

SHIFT + i to insert

type char/text to insert

ESC

after the ESC all new text will be typed in vertically !!!!!!!1



save session:
:mksession ~/mysession.vim


restore session:
vim -S ~/mysession.vim
vim + :source ~/mysession.vim


splitting windows:
==================

While running vim:

:sp filename for a horizontal split
:vsp filename or :vs filename for a vertical split

Ctrl+W, Q to close one

Ctrl+W, Ctrl+W to switch between windows

Ctrl+W, J (xor K, H, L) to switch to adjacent window (intuitively up, down, left, right)



move to shell to ls for files:
=============================
:sh
exit - to quit shell


files and folders:
==================

ls current dir:
:e . 


buffers:
========

new file-name
new //without any file name, a new file is openend

:ls
for list of open buffers

:e edit a new buffer in the current tab
:e <file>: Edit another file in a new buffer in the curent tab and switch to it
:q - quit the current tab.
:bp previous buffer
:bn next buffer
:bn (n a number) move to n'th buffer
:bfirst
:blast
:bdelete delete the current buffer
:b <filename-part> with tab-key providing auto-completion (awesome !!)

to get GVIM settings:
===================
:set tabstop ------------------- > if you don't write a value, it prints out the current value.


find & replace words in a file:
===============================
The :substitute command searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string. 
There are many options, but these are what you probably want:

:%s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.
% = all file

:s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.

to fine and replace in selected section, first select, then use
:'<,'>s/foo/bar/g

g - is used to replace all occurnaces in a line, section, file,...
without 'g', only the first occurance will be replaced.

:%s/foo/bar/gc
Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

:%s/foo/bar/gci
Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

:%s/foo\c/bar/gc is the same because \c makes the search case insensitive.
This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default).

:%s/foo/bar/gcI
Change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the I flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

:%s/foo\C/bar/gc is the same because \C makes the search case sensitive.
This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive.




to get rid of highlights:
========================
:noh

remove unwanted spaces to a block of code:
=========================================
for example, first make the desired settings:
set expandtab
set shifttab=2
set tabstop=2
then, select the code and press '='

%s/\s\+$//e

replace a word in block:
========================
select the code (v) then press :
then use:
s/foo/bar/gc





kosta, new plugins:

DifDiff orig_dir new_dir

:vsplit file

from commandline:
gvimdiff file1 file2

colors for vimdiff:
==================
:color molok
:colordefault
:color desert
:color pyte //recommended
:color peaksea //recommended

]c - next diff
[c - prev diff
do (diff obtain) - take diff to my current file
dp (diff put) - put diff from my current file to the diff file
CTRL+W w - moving cursor to the other file
zo          - open folded text
zc          - close folded text
:diffupdate - re-scan the files for differences

If you load up two files in splits (:vs or :sp), you can do
:diffthis on each window and achieve a diff of files that were already loaded in buffers
:diffoff can be used to turn off the diff mode. 



vimrc and gvimrc
==================
The gvimrc file is where GUI-specific startup commands should be placed. It is always sourced after the vimrc file.
You can use the gvimrc files to set up your own customized menus (see :menu) and initialize other things 
that you may want to set up differently from the terminal version.

usually use vimrc !
