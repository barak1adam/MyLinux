Linux packages management:
==========================

*Each distribution has a default list of repositories, from which it install specific versions of packages.
When we add a new package, its version and sources are downloaded from one of that repos.

*If we like to add a new repo to the list, we can explicitly do it by "apt-add-repository <repo name>"
to remove a repo,  "apt-add-repository --remove <repo name>"

*then we can run apt-get update:
apt-get update updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.
it like "pull" all latest packages versions into a local cache / list
After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed.

*apt-get upgrade actually installs newer versions of the packages you have.
