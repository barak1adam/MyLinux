vrrpd is checking if one of the virtual ip is owned by the router. if yes - set priority to 255, else 100 or user value
vrrpd is checking if owner is set and priority is not 255 - return error.
now we are in a legal state where owner is set becuase it really owns an IP and priority is 255.
so actually ownership is set by vrrpd and is not required by CLI.

then it is using owner flag when entering or leaving master state:
when entering master state - if not an owner, add a new IP interface with the vmac. if owner, just set the vmac to the real IP.
when leaving master state - if not an owner, remove the IP interface with its vmac. if owner, set the real mac again to the real ip.




svrrp (vrrp.c):
ownership is checked again when virtual addresses are configured. exactly as done by vrrpd. why? don't see it is handled by the vrrpd...

the functions of updating ownership when real interfaces are added or removed are not used !


keepalived:

1. is ownership is handled - mean is priority is set automatically to 255 (if not confiugred by the user)?
why priority is abled to change in case of ownership ??

2. vmac:
the rfc says always to use the vmac. (as done in vrrpd)
so why is the #use real mac option allowed?

3. how ownership is updated when real interfaces are added or removed ?
