312:

if V20 dts, is_oob_phy is 0 and phy_addr = -1 ------> no hw polling, no sw polling
link is up
but had issues after reboot

aligned dts like V8:
sw polling and hw polling are enabled

hw polling + sw polling
(address is correct)
port 12 bug
remove hw polling resolve port 12 bug

hw polling, not sw polling
(sw polling not working because wrong address)
had no port 12 bug and disable sw polling to avoid syslog read errors


in V8 we had also SW+HW polling
but wrong remap size leading to wrong readings in SW polling
