### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks

### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks

sf read addr offset|partition len       - read `len' bytes starting at
                                          `offset' or from start of mtd
                                          `partition'to memory at `addr'
sf write addr offset|partition len      - write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf erase offset|partition [+]len        - erase `len' bytes from `offset'
                                          or from start of mtd `partition'
                                         `+len' round up `len' to block size
sf update addr offset|partition len     - erase and write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf protect lock/unlock sector len       - protect/unprotect 'len' bytes starting

sf - SPI flash sub-system

Usage:
sf probe [[bus:]cs] [hz] [mode] - init flash device on given SPI bus
                                  and chip select
sf read addr offset|partition len       - read `len' bytes starting at
                                          `offset' or from start of mtd
                                          `partition'to memory at `addr'
sf write addr offset|partition len      - write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf erase offset|partition [+]len        - erase `len' bytes from `offset'
                                          or from start of mtd `partition'
                                         `+len' round up `len' to block size
sf update addr offset|partition len     - erase and write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf protect lock/unlock sector len       - protect/unprotect 'len' bytes starting
                                          at address 'sector'

sf test offset len              - run a very basic destructive test

sf - SPI flash sub-system

Usage:
sf probe [[bus:]cs] [hz] [mode] - init flash device on given SPI bus
                                  and chip select
sf read addr offset|partition len       - read `len' bytes starting at
                                          `offset' or from start of mtd
                                          `partition'to memory at `addr'
sf write addr offset|partition len      - write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf erase offset|partition [+]len        - erase `len' bytes from `offset'
                                          or from start of mtd `partition'
                                         `+len' round up `len' to block size
sf update addr offset|partition len     - erase and write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf protect lock/unlock sector len       - protect/unprotect 'len' bytes starting
                                          at address 'sector'

sf test offset len              - run a very basic destructive test

sf - SPI flash sub-system

Usage:
sf probe [[bus:]cs] [hz] [mode] - init flash device on given SPI bus
                                  and chip select
sf read addr offset|partition len       - read `len' bytes starting at
                                          `offset' or from start of mtd
                                          `partition'to memory at `addr'
sf write addr offset|partition len      - write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf erase offset|partition [+]len        - erase `len' bytes from `offset'
                                          or from start of mtd `partition'
                                         `+len' round up `len' to block size
sf update addr offset|partition len     - erase and write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf protect lock/unlock sector len       - protect/unprotect 'len' bytes starting
                                          at address 'sector'

sf test offset len              - run a very basic destructive test

sf - SPI flash sub-system

Usage:
sf probe [[bus:]cs] [hz] [mode] - init flash device on given SPI bus
                                  and chip select
sf read addr offset|partition len       - read `len' bytes starting at

sf write addr offset|partition len      - write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf erase offset|partition [+]len        - erase `len' bytes from `offset'
                                          or from start of mtd `partition'
                                         `+len' round up `len' to block size
sf update addr offset|partition len     - erase and write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf protect lock/unlock sector len       - protect/unprotect 'len' bytes starting
                                          at address 'sector'

sf test offset len              - run a very basic destructive test

sf - SPI flash sub-system

Usage:
sf probe [[bus:]cs] [hz] [mode] - init flash device on given SPI bus
                                  and chip select
sf read addr offset|partition len       - read `len' bytes starting at
                                          `offset' or from start of mtd
                                          `partition'to memory at `addr'
sf write addr offset|partition len      - write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf erase offset|partition [+]len        - erase `len' bytes from `offset'
                                          or from start of mtd `partition'
                                         `+len' round up `len' to block size
sf update addr offset|partition len     - erase and write `len' bytes from memory
                                          at `addr' to flash at `offset'
                                          or to start of mtd `partition'
sf protect lock/unlock sector len       - protect/unprotect 'len' bytes starting
                                          at address 'sector'

sf test offset len              - run a very basic destructive test
