Hi Stephen

A quick question please.
If we won't have a quick answer I will create a ticket.

For the PS-PL we've got:
-The AXI inteface for registers access - works perfect.
-One ETH controller for data - trouble shooting it now...

For the data we need GEM0 in gmii mode to communicate ETH framse between our FPGA and the PS application.
No phys connected on this GEM0, we just need it to interface with the PL.

Trying to enable this GEM0 in the DTB, but the MACB driver is failed to probe for this GEM0.

Here are the errors from dmesg:

[    4.830106] macb ff0b0000.ethernet: failed to add to PM domain domain8: -13
[    4.837070] macb: probe of ff0b0000.ethernet failed with error -13


Here is my DTS relevant section:

&gem0 {
 compatible = "cdns,zynqmp-gem", "cdns,gem";
 phy-mode = "gmii";
 status = "okay";
        fixed-link {
                speed = <1000>;
                full-duplex;
                //pause;
        };
};

I need it as kernel eth1, so I also added " ethernet1 = &gem0;" to the alias section.

BTW, GEM3 works perfect.

what do you think is missing for GEM0?

The full DTB along with its reversed DTS (compiled back with DTC for your convenience) are attached.

Thanks
Barak
