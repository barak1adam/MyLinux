QSPI NOR

I found the CPLD reset


ETH PHY

he wanted me to debug u-boot
I focused on diffs to 108 and found the MSCC PHY missing (he didnt read emails and didnt se the MSCC)

then I cancelled GEM0 errors and fixed PHY ID errors

still no ping, still pushed me to debug

I opened u-boot printouts and google
I pushed to clocks

he showed me the MII and MDIO dumps on u-boot

He pushed to kernel clocks (no kernel yet...)
I changed the clock on Vivado and cancelled the random MAC to resolve it

he showed me DTG - was helpful


Kernel panic

he showed me the booti and bootm

he pushed me to initrd I tried initramfs cpio and it worked better

he showed FIT offset - but the issue might be only the offests of the images (kernel, dtb, rootfs)

he pushed me to bootm but I got back to booti to move forward

systemd - I resolved (he told not to change rootfs config...)

no console - I resolved

user passwords I resolved

image.ub to repack - I found
