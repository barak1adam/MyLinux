AOS supports 2 NOR flashes to enale update
The user can update the standby NOR, the CPLD blocks updates of the active one
CPLD let you toggle between active / standby
Once the boot is not completed successfully (for example becuse of issues upon writing/updating the boot SW to the standby), then a WD timer
is expired and the boot will start from the other nor

We simply dont support update of the NOR, so wd and toggling is not needed

Usually they disable the wd in the u-boot code under LAST_STAGE_INIT, but in XO-126 I didnt even enable it in menuconfig.
