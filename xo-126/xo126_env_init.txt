Unable to store u-boot ENV in SPI NOR FLASH:
============================================

Issue description:
I am trying to enable the u-boot enviornment variables saving, once it is enabled then u-boot is hanged upon booting.

In the u-boot config menu, once I am enabling the "Environment in SPI Flash" and excluding the option of "Environment is not stored", then it hangs.


I followed the wiki to debug the u-boot:
https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842557/Debug+U-boot#DebugU-boot-RelatedLinks

Here is the analysis:
=====================
 
env_init is called under the scope of list of functions during pre-reloacation. 
the list is init_sequence_f in board_f.c
if one of the functions in this list is failed and returns with error, hang() is called and u-boot is halted.

env_init fails because a driver is not found:

env_init()
	calls env_driver_lookup() ------> driver not found, error ENODEV is returned
		calls env_get_location() --------> implemented in zynqmp.c and find location of ENV as ENVL_SPI_FLASH, as expected.
			call _env_driver_lookup( location = ENVL_SPI_FLASH) ------ > fails to find a driver and returns NULL
			
			
so the question is why the driver for SPI FLASH is not found?

All my debug is done while the boot mode is hard set to JTAG.
I would like to debug the SPI_FLASH boot mode, how can I do that?
