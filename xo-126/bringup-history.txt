I got the board with working JTAG on Tuesday 19.7 11:30

After few hours I got FSBL loaded,and DDR working (with hello program running) !!!

One day after we had u-boot and kernel running

NOR was tested and working on Thursday including example tests after fixed by Yotam and disabled the other NOR and the CPLD logic.

2 weeks spent on u-boot: building outside petalinux, compare to 108, all done for debug.
got the NOR , "UART"  and ETH PHY issues.

vacation 2 weeks started on 5.8 (friday)

back on 21.8, back to bringup on 23.8 Tuesday
Till Thursday found the issue of CPLD and it fixed the NOR and the UART
learned to complie DTS by DTG

On Friday & Saturday started with ETH PHY - enable the correct driver, get rid of errors, and work for ping.
Couldn't work on Sunday for it. Monday to Tuesday morning - Ping resolved.
Tuesday up to midnight - kernel was up too by TFTP !
