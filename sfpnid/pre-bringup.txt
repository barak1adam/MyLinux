pre-bringup:
============

NAND selection:
---------------

nand types: SLC vs MLC
SLC (Single Level Cell) - reliable, long life cycle
MLC (Multi Level Cell) - shorter EOL by the vendors, cheaper, more space.

SLC is preferred to avoid EOL.

if we use SPI-FLASH chip, this is a fixed protocol, we will be flexible in replacing the NAND vendors.
SPI-FLASH lets you program the NAND from outside.
Without SPI-FLASH we will program the NAND from u-boot or Linux

It requres that NAND will be compatible to the ROM page size (provided by the CPU vendor)

Using RAMFS will let us skip the work with NAND and move forward with simultaneous dev

Kernel driver usually we have to configure ECC


BuildRoot vs Yocto:
-------------------

BR - fast ramup, you alwaye one set of packages
Yocto - complex, flexible in changeing the set of packages, good for large projects / desktops.


SPI to FPGA
------------

-tun/tup - very simple. user space app, overhead of context switches. might be good enough for our needs.

-FPGA to mimik NIC over SPI emulation 
For example use Microchip enc28j60 ETH/SPI release in the kernel and let the FPGA implement the slave side as that chip.
reliable, released in the kernel, efficient master implmenetation.

-Let the FPGA be the master and the CPU will be the slave
only possbile using the CPU M4
Linux Kernel on A7 doesn't support SPI slave because of the high clock rates.
