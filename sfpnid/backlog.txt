backlog sfpnid:
===============

barak:

upgrade kernel
change DTS file names to 151
how to change partitions
DDR - learning with Naftali
try to decrease timer frequency
valgrind
TeamCity
add product.conf to ver file
gdb training
ramfs training

ST - what is used finally - FMC or NAND (for example ECC settings)
ST - review USB settings I got from Emmanuel
ST - review memory layout. for example kernel is loaded into 0xc2000000
ST - debug of u-boot and tf-a
ST - review DDR training


together:

new setup in LAB including Spirent

Jac:

invalid len
improve and align driver to SFS

driver leftovers by jac:
- fix compatible strings
- load percent counter % (time in driver vs time no in drv)
- MTU is hardcoded in the code ---- need to read it from the interface dynamically
- replace the include <linux/spi/spidev.h> (but maybe this is ok ?) and replace by including our driver.h (which includes what is required)
- remove linux includes in user_ifs.h

use select in the driver or timer optimization

optimize BR image size
CubeIDE plugin to Eclipse
try to use M4 (elf example)
core dumps
unify the driver module into the kernel
successfully enable BR users table, and remove the workarround scripts:
	more, dev/x permissions
	admin / root users
	fix sudo
Management inside a service (control tag)


Josh:
Linux mode
Syslog:
add show info, show error
add logrotate
fix - if same lines are writtend in a row, they are not loged ----------- > fixed. (email by Alex)
remote syslog
Hard (cold) FPGA resets
ntp porting and integration into dhcp
move setif and initd to rcS.d
move dhclient to rcS.d

Alex:
OAM
in XG we did LT and CCM in CPU, dmm and service turn up in FPGA
Tag manipulations conditions  ‘absent’ and  ‘any’ 
Tag manipulations action  ‘strip’ 
PCP map/remark must be redesigned and re-implemented.
DSCP map/remark (?)
Tag manipulations on downstream for q-in-q services
TPID configuration for internal tag.
Port statistics
Keep alive tools
FPGA configuration TLVs revision
UPEDD-47290, Jac removed the warnings, need to handle with Shay

serial numbers to get into the show version
