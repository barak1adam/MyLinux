if SPI slave on M4:

FPGA sends data, then should be transmitted to A7

If A7 wants to transfer data, needs to implement a protocol: interrupt the FPGA to start a transaction

Kenrel can't be slave since a slave has to respond in nano seconds to master requests

power can be saved to A7 by using it only if M4 has something recieved.


if SPI master on A7:

A7 power can be saved too, only work on FPGA interrupts when SPI transactions starts

simple

no comm between the cores

Baruch:

transaction overhead is only one time of CS for a new transaction
length must recieved anyway for the master to stop the transaction

DMA is handled by the driver, length is not needed. check the driver
