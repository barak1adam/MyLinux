tun / tup interfaces:
=====================

write to tun/tap intf -----------> kernel rx
read from tun/tap intf ------------> kernel tx

tap - eth frames
tun - ip frames, no eth headers

/dev/net/tap

creation by root, or by having CAP_NET_ADMIN permissions

enable persistance - other users (programs owned by other users, rather than the creator) can aatach and use the interface
ioctl(tap_fd, TUNSETPERSIST, 1)

Set permissions:
     e.g. chmod 0666 /dev/net/tun
     There's no harm in allowing the device to be accessible by non-root users,
     since CAP_NET_ADMIN is required for creating network devices or for 
     connecting to network devices which aren't owned by the user in question.
     If you want to create persistent devices and give ownership of them to 
     unprivileged users, then you need the /dev/net/tun device to be usable by
     those users.
