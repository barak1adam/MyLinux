FSBL (ARM trusted FW):
======================

take DDR2 DTS settings from Cube

compile DTS and change DTB file in main boot-loaders menu

change other params in DTS like board name, etc, if needed

check I2C to PMIC is enabled and power to DDR

why PMIC is not marked with dm-pre-reloc

how to connect with GDB?
