meeting with baruch:
--------------------
introduction to the new board / project - optics, fpga, cpu.

yocto / buildroot

recommendations for bringup steps

recommendations for nand preparations


packets to cpu - a critical path:
---------------------------------
POC

reuse as much code as possible, use dts.

fpga sends a packet ---> spi --- >  dma ---> ram ----> tun/tap into kernel networking stack

is it possible to have the cpu as spi slave? to save the interrupt overhead for rx packet


kernel space:
=============
stm32dma driver ----> kernel dmaengine ---> masterspi-stm32.c (dma slave?)


user space:
===========
get the buffers from spi like spidev and use tun / tap
