in FSBL:

enable I2C
connect to PMIC via I2C

configure PMIC to enable power for DDR:

a. enable LDO3 (VDD1_DDR) in bypass mode. The software waits at least for a further 100 us.

b. enable DDR_VREF (VREF_DDR).

c. enable BUCK2 (VDD2_DDR) at 1.2 V. The software waits for at least 1.4 ms for BUCK2 ready

DDR Controller configuration:
