tkos thirs meeting - buildroot:
===============================

stm32mp defconfig - should make all relevant settings for me in BR.
BR menus: "In tree.." vs custom - file in linux / in u-boot, etc... vs a custom file that I use in BR or locally
toolchain - external saves much time. bootlin is recommended. external means precompiled, tar file foramt.
	I also selecte musl instead of glibc / uclibc. it is smaller.
our current dist is minimal  - kernel and busybox.
I can delete output/build to clean all compilation or run make clean
porting our code:
	can use external packages like in UM 9.2. the advantage is that no changes in the buildroot code, but to defconfig
changes to source code - can be done locally and avoid override with new downloads - UM 8.14.6

build env - you get them all in the MK file. 
when calling the Makefile of the package, all settings are there.
use CC instead of GCC. (GCC is of the host, CC is of the env toolchain)

what to save in BB - defconfig, OS-V
	git clone os-v
	git clone BR
	make defconfig
	apply patches
	make

check on ST eval board - 
	how to boot from USB or UART
	how to burn the NAND after boot (if there is a NAND)
	try to boot from NAND after flashing
