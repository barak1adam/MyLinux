Final steps:

==========

 

sudo apt-get install linux-headers-4.4.0-174-generic

cd os-v/router/module/x86-lte

vim Makefile – set kernel to 4.4.0-174-generic

make gobi

git status

Incerment the version of the DEB in its control file

make all

Then we will have a new *.deb package for installation

Delete the old deb !!!

Git status
















The gobi kernel modules ( the binaries) are part of the deb package

 

To make the gobi kernel modules, we should do the following on the build machine:

You have to install corresponding kernel headers package first, like:

#    sudo apt-get install linux-headers-4.4.0-51-generic

Then build the kernel modules:

os-v/router/module/x86-lte/Makefile –

run make gobi

Then integrate the new kernel bin files in a new DEB package:

Incerment the version of the DEB in its control file

Run make all

Then we will have a new *.deb package for installation

 

NOTE:

Target machine (the target Ubuntu machine MUST run the same kernel version in which the gobi modules were built for. It must match 1:1 !!!

 

Build machine must be X86, 64 bit

 

Upon MOS upgrade, if a new Debian pkg is available, it will be installed automatically

 

Dan – what is the /etc/mrv-release for ??
