Meeting with Janith

LTE is used not just for backup, but for regular / internet traffic by the customers.

IP through -
On server side you get one IP dynamically from the LTE network
For each sim card you get one IP
we want to share one IP between the VNFs -
because both regular traffic and customer traffic (S-VLAN) have to go out with one source IP
so we use NAT for that purpose which is CPU expensive or "IP through" which
is a feature given by the Connector.

C-tag is ususally replaced with an S-tag towards the noraml NNI S-port
NNI is layer 2, only going via LTE in the backup scenario, then L3 is involved with GRE
(it is configurable - S tag might be also added to C tag - QinQ, not just replace)

Same configuration about the S-Vlan should be set by the user on the sd-wan vnf,
to enable the backup setup to be like the normal.

GRE is secured way to go over the L3 cloud

Fragmentation:
because LTE network is limited to ~1500 byte frames
Telstra allows customer jumbo frames
it cannot be done on the packet processor on the nid side because it is layer3
it can be done on the ARM on nid side, but better on the server CPU.
