===========

u-boot:
------

in OPS install dir, we can find the u-boot compile script.
~/mrv_dev/vrrp_ipv6_vrf/build/install/u-boot-2013.01-msys-v13.git/build/compile

source code:
------------
many unrelevant c files. tip: grep in o files, so it make me search just
stuff relevant to our u-boot.

marvell boards for this release is undermv_ebu

git log -p . :
check where we did our changes

git show initial commit of Marvell to see Marvell changes

u-boot purpose is to initial minimal subsystems and
wait in a while loop for commands

upon any command - the relevant subsystem is initialized and the cmd
is executed

bin header

time estimated for u-boot upgrade:
2-3 months including tests

same source code, any build generates different binaries - a binary 
for each board.

upgrade:
--------
very similar to CPSS upgrade flow !
avise Pavel

u-boot is an open source
1. update local git from upstream repository
2. Let's assume we have marvel u-boot #1
detect previous initial Marvell commit for #1 and apply it on top of vanilla

3. unpack new marvel u-boot #2
4. cp it to the our u-boot after step 2 is done. create a commit for all changes and add
it to a new branch

5. on this branch port all Adva commits.
