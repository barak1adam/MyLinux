compare of embedded web servers
===============================

Apache:

reliable
popular
secured

too much comprehensive
need resources
bigger footprint (~30M)

not a simple build and maintain


Nginx:

very popular
high scale: not threaded oriented arch but event driven

light - low footprint (~10M)
low memory resources
very powerful > 35% than Apache

simple load balancing
fault tolerance
auto-indexing
virtual servers (both name- and IP-based)
mod_rewrite
access control


lot of optional modules and prebuilt Linux packages


LightHTTPd

very light, designed for embedded systems
most popular in Embedded world

effective memory management of cpu load
FastCGI, SCGI
Auth
Output-Compression
URL-Rewriting

up to 10000 simultaneous client sessions

support PHP and dynamic databases

very simple to use and configure

one *.conf file


Athtpd

GET, POST and HEAD Methods

File system Access

Callbacks to C functions

MIME type support

CGI mechanism through the OBJLOADER package or through a simple tcl interpreter

Basic and Digest (MD5) Authentication

Directory Listing

Extendable Internal Resources
