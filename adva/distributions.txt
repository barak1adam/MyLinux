Our distributions:

OPS
====
not a distribution
toolchain from marvell
kernel 3.10 + marvell patches (cpss lsp)
more binaries and tools we need are compiled and installed...

OPX
===
toolchain of "buildtools"
we build openclovis, broadcom BCM, main, main_dev
distribuition is a collection of Ubuntu 12.04 binaries, zipped.
not dynamic becuase the Ubuntu was compiled with some kernel headers and libs and cannot be built again
incompatibility with new packages that compile with latest headers or libs.


Agema, EDE:
===========
1. EDE root fs build
2. kernel 4.12, 4.13
3. gcc 4.8.4, we need 4.9
4. glibc compatibility
