The MOS image file transfer is terminating before it reaches 100%
MOS 4.5.5(18967) , FPGA 0x11 to 4.5.91

arrived from field with backup version of 4_5_7 and missig config lines
that explaing why mgmt connection was lost

successfully file transfer in the lab + successful upgrade to 4.5.91
backup partition was missing configuration
Ron:
config is copied to backup or maunally by the command "copy startup-config backup-partition"
or it is done automatically on upgrade.
but since upgrade failed, it was not coppied.

replaced with other device by the technician
no file system corruption (none...)

we compared to other devices and found that from version above 4_3_2, it's OK to have none
