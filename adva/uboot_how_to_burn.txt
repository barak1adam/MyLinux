Programming u-boot to a virgin OS-V device - no u-boot exists:
==================================================
If you see messages "BootRom < some message>" and you do not see u-boot comes up , it is likely that there is no u-boot on device.

The instruction assumes you have "minicom" uart terminal ( or another terminal app that support xmodem file transfer ) installed on your host PC.

1. launch minicom on your uart port and wait until you see the message " trying uart"

2. At this point, the board is ready to receive files. press CTRL+A . then Z , then s.

3. choose "ascii"  and send xmodem_boot.pattern
 
4. File will be sent to device, you should see wierd characters printed on screen 

5. Repeat the send file operation, only now, choose u-boot-...-uart.bin, and "xmodem" in the send file menu.

6. u-boot will be downloaded to device . now you can start burning images as described earlier. rename the u-boot file to "u-boot.bin" and burn it by "bubt".

*.pattern file, *-uart.bin file, *u-boot*.bin file - all can be found on TeamCity images.
