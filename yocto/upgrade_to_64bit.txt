64 bit support, meeting with Dan, Ilja, Andrejs, 22.09.2020
============================================================

Dan, reasons for upgrade:
BIOS is usually 64bit
prividers env and diag are 64 - when we have an issue we don't know it is because the different arch or not
32 bit have the limit of 4G memory pages for routing

what was done:
yocto
bcm
clovis
poky

still working on application layer

master branch will be 64 bit and will support the option in install dev script to build 32 bit

no issue with uploads since 32 bit and 64 bit sdks are differnent names

will shcedule another meeting when the app layer is done, to sync about:
I want all the yocto build to be automatically backward compatible to 32.
to be able build yocto for 32

they are saying that they addes flags etc... no changes to the code for BCM, clovis, etc for 64
e.g. if I build for 32 then I get the binaries as for today.
