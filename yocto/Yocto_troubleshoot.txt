Kosta, Yocto trouble shoot:
==========================
*.ko are built with 32 bit compile settings only by step 1 and not by step 3

how to swtich to another branch - 
change bcm-sdk_git.bb file ? if I do it, fetch always fails with connection error to BB
checkout to the other branch locally?

I tried to rm bcm_sdk under workspace/sources
then I fail to build: source tree for recipe bcm-sdk not found
